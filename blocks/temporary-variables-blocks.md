# Temporary variables blocks

Instead of calling every time the same blocks to get a value in an event, you can get it one time, and save it temporarily with the temporary variables blocks. Here is the example :

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/VariablesBlocks.JPG" alt=""><figcaption><p>The message's content is saved in a temporary variable, and the content is got later to reply to the message.</p></figcaption></figure>

These variables can't be shared between events, and are deleted after the execution.
