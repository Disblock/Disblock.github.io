# Events

## How to use events&#x20;

With Disblock, every action flow start by an event. We wait that something happens first, then we can run our action flow.

You can see that events may have some related variables blocks. Here is an example :

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/EventBlock.PNG" alt=""><figcaption><p>You can see that these events have a "message" variable block related.</p></figcaption></figure>

When using these events, you can use the variable block to get the sent/deleted message, and use   it in your action flow. This way, you can get informations from the message that triggered the event.
